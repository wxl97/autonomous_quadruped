DWAPlannerROS:
  max_vel_x: 0.5  # Maximum forward velocity
  min_vel_x: 0.1  # Minimum forward velocity
  max_vel_theta: 1.0  # Maximum rotational velocity
  min_in_place_vel_theta: 0.4  # Minimum rotational velocity in place
  acc_lim_x: 1.0  # Maximum acceleration in x
  acc_lim_theta: 2.0  # Maximum rotational acceleration
  xy_goal_tolerance: 0.2  # Goal tolerance in the x-y plane
  yaw_goal_tolerance: 0.1  # Goal tolerance in yaw
  latch_xy_goal_tolerance: true  # Continue to move towards the goal if goal tolerance is achieved
  # Additional parameters to tune the behavior
